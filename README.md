# AB-See: Puzzle IT Out!

## About AB-See

"A-B-See" is an interactive visual puzzle game that debuted in [March 2021](https://sketchthedocs.github.io/AB-See/helloworld/about/) as a segment on the [Hello World](https://aka.ms/helloworld) on [Microsoft Learn TV](https://aka.ms/learntv). Learn more [about it here](https://aka.ms/visual/absee).

## How does it work?

The concept is simple. I **show** you visual clues that represent a _person_, a _service_ or a _concept_ - and you **tell* me what you think the answer is. It could be a [Rebus Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebus) like the one shown in the explainer below, or it could be more elaborate (as shown in the next section).

## HelloWorld: ABsee Example

This was [one of the earliest clues](https://sketchthedocs.github.io/AB-See/puzzles/004/) we broadcast on the #HelloWorldLive show. It was shown as a 30-second timelapse of the clue as-it-was-drawn. The hangman-like blanks (with filled in letters) gives you a strong sense of what the answer might be. Can you guess the answer?

If you guessed `"Sidecar"` design pattern, you'd be right! And the bonus 4-letter product we were looking for is -- [Dapr](https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/03/02/a-visual-guide-to-dapr/).

## Interstitial Events: Example

The concept was recently repurposed as [_interstitial_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_television_show) content for use in online events, during the breaks between sessions. 

Recently, we reused the same concept to create puzzles as _interstitial_ content for an online event focused on [Azure Functions: OpenAPI and Power Platforms](https://dev.to/nitya/series/13728). 

I expect to repurpose the concept for other interactive community engagemnets as well. Look at the end of this page for _bundles_ associated with each.

Want to try your hand at playing the game? I'm using the [revealjs](https://revealjs.com) open-source presentation framework to host a carousel of clues on [this GitHub Pages endpoint](https://sketchthedocs.github.io/ab-see-play) for this repo. Pick one of the puzzle bundles below, to visit that select subset of puzzles.  d

* Scroll `left` to right to see the timelapse videos for each clue. Use those to try to guess the response by yourself. 
* Scroll `down` on any clue to see a static image of that clue, with additional hints to help.
* Scroll `down` once more to see the answer, along with additional resource links to help you learn more on that topic.

Got it?
Good.
